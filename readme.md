# DSL_Music_Project

* Repository summarizing my final project for Deep And Shallow Learning for Music and Audio
* At present this failed to reproduce significant results
* This work is mostly based on the code found in https://github.com/sonycslparis/cgae-invar

## Contents:
* Course_Project_oded_Drori notebook - main article, project report
* misc_tasks, exploring_MIRdata notebooks - misc notebooks used to explore a dataset and perform file conversions/loadings
* generate_tests, generate_wavs flp files - used to generate the test/train files (requires FL Studio)
* input folder - contains .wav files used to test the model
* output folder - contains .save files representing the models, .pyc files represnting cqt outputs and .wav files representing the audio outputs of the test data

## TODO:
* update results after retraining with 22050Hz .wav files
* retest after conforming to identical venv as original work
